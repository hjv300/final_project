***Advanced Topics in Natural Language Processing***

This is the repository final individual report for the course Advanced Topics in Natural Language Processing from University of Copenhagen.
This code expects a cuda GPU to work so please have that in mind, otherwise execution will take an eternity.
To run the code:
```bash
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
conda activate <env>
python3 experiment1b_finetuning.py
python3 experiment2_finetuning.py
```
